 Hello, My name is <b>Dimitri Filippatos</b>.  
    I am a Senior here at St. John's and my major is <strong>Cyber Security</strong>.  As a kid I was always interested in technology and what we can achieve with it.
    With techonology being a major part in the world it is very important to understand it and be able to apply it to all areas in life.
    I was born and raised on Long Island and enjoy traveling in the summertime.  Here is a list of some of the countries I've been to: 
 </body></p>
    <ol>
<li style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255);"> <b>Greece</b>  <body> - I've been to Greece every year for the last three years.  I have lots of family and there has been lots of history there.  It is always nice to see the amazing views and eat the great food.</body></li>
<li style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255)"> <b>Curacao</b> <body> - My experience with Curacao was very nice I went in the summer of 2021 and while there was many covid restrictions I had a lot of fun spending time with familt.</body></li>
<li style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255)"> <b>Aruba</b> <body> - This the first vacation that I had went on with my cousins and it was a very memorable time and the memories will last forever. </body></li>
<li style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255);"> <b>Mexico</b> <body>- - My family and I went to Mexico in 2017 and we stayed on a beautiful resort.  We spent our times lounging by the pools and enjoying all the delicious food. </body></li>
<li style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255);"> <b>Bahamas</b> <body> - I only spent a couple days in the Bahamas with my family when I was much younger but I can remember all the cool excursions that we did see all different beautiful sights and sounds.</body></li>
    </ol>
<p>
<body>I graduated high school in 2022 and I have been at St. John's since. I've been trying to further my education here at St. John's and I am working on getting my degree in Cyber Security.  
    I love to learn new things in the field and will strive to be my best.  I like to connect with my peers to help further gain an understanding for things and it also helps build connections.</body>


<body> I haven't really worked on too many project other than ones that I have done in other courses.
       I have experience working together with others in a group to complete work and other assignments.
<body>I am most proficient in <b>Java</b> since that is the main language I have been studying here at St. John's.
    I have also had experience using <b>SQL</b> and I am taking other classes to further my knowledge on the subject.
</body>

I do also like to watch movies my favorite genre of movie is comedy but I do enjoy action films too.
Some of my favorite movies are Dumb and Dumber, The Planet of the Ape trilogy and the John Wick Movies.
Movies will either teach you a really good lesson or give a nice laugh when needed they are a really good way to unwind and relax.

I enjoy listening to all differnt genres of music, there is always something to listen to at some point in time. 
    I would say that my top three genres of music are Rap, Hip-Hop and Pop.  A song I like to listen to in order to get the vibes up are Adventure of a Lifetime by Coldplay.  The music video is the cherry on top to a great song.

 A website that I would recommend checking out if you are interested in sports is ESPN.  It is the hub for all sports and you can see the scores around the world to keep track of what you cannot watch.
    It is also great for catching up with things you may have missed with articles and highlights to show the most improtant moments if you do not want to watch full games.
